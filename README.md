Sales Data Analysis using Excel-
This repository contains an Excel sheet that focuses on analyzing sales data for a company. The following steps were undertaken to analyze and visualize the data:

Data Cleaning: The initial step involved cleaning the dataset by removing any null values. This ensured that the data used for analysis was complete and accurate, providing a reliable foundation for further exploration.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Once the data was cleaned, exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns within the sales data. Various statistical techniques and visualizations were employed to uncover trends, relationships, and key statistics.

Visualization: To enhance the understanding of the sales data, visualizations such as pie charts and bar graphs were created. Pie charts were used to illustrate the distribution of sales across different categories or product lines, providing a clear representation of the relative proportions. Bar graphs, on the other hand, were employed to showcase the comparison of sales figures between different time periods, regions, or any other relevant variables.

By following this analysis pipeline, we were able to extract meaningful information from the sales data, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and identify potential areas for improvement. The cleaned dataset and the visualizations created during the analysis process are included in this repository for reference and further exploration.

Feel free to explore the Excel sheet and leverage the insights generated to gain a deeper understanding of the sales performance of the company.
